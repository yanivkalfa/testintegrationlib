/**
* @brief	Listener for scan events on a IBScanDevice. This listener should be registered by an
* 			application using the setScanDeviceListener(IBScanDeviceListener) method.
* 			<p>
*			Most of these events occur after beginCaptureImage() has been called.  If fingers 
*			are touching the platen when the capture is begun, deviceImagePreviewAvailable()
*			will be called immediately and again once no fingers are touching.  Periodically, until a final 
*			image is achieved, deviceImagePreviewAvailable() will return the current scanner 
*			image.  Changes in the quantity and quality of finger presses will result in 
*			deviceFingerCountChanged() or deviceFingerQualityChanged() calls.  If 
*			the selected scan type is a rolled finger scan, then deviceAcquisitionBegun()
*			will be called when a flat finger scan has been acquired and the user should begin rolling his 
*			or her finger to the left; when the left-roll is complete, deviceAcquisitionCompleted()
*			will be called, and the user should begin rolling back toward the right.  When a quality scan 
*			with the correct number of fingers (and a full finger roller, if applicable) is available or 
*			captureImageManually() is called, deviceImageResultAvailable() or
*			deviceImageResultExtendedAvailable() will supply a final scan image to the application.
